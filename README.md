# Geminer

## Introduction

Geminer is a tool that was originally designed to convert a PicoCMS blog into a static version for Gemini. In fact, it can act as a markdown-based static site generator.

## Features

* Markdown to Gemtext conversion
* Custom conversion for local links (soon)
* Custom metadata gathering
* Custom indexes (for instance by tags, by authors, or any metadata you desire)
* Jinja2 templating

## Configuration

Soon. For now you can read [the example config](config.py.example).

## Gemini capsules using Geminer

* [Hashtagueule](gemini://hashtagueule.fr)

## TODO

* add parameter to give a function to treat local links
* clean the code (lots of work)
* change configuration format?
