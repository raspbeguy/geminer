# indexable properties to fetch in frontmatter
# A lot of CMS will manage properties like tags ans authors, which are written
# in the frontmatter, and are used to make subgroups of posts.
# This setting enables to do the same for any frontmatter property you wish.
#
# Each indexable property generate two views:
#   * per-value post index:  This is a list of links to posts that have a given
#                            value of the property. There are as many per-value
#                            indexes as properties values.
#   * property values index: This is a list of links to per-value indexes.
#                            There is only one page of this kind, and it can be
#                            disabled.
#
# Exemple: if the property is tags, then it will generate a tag index tags.gmi,
# which will link to some subindexes like tags/computer (assuming computer is
# an existing tag).
#
# Specify here a list of dictionnary, each one with the following keys:
#   * property (mandatory):     name of the property present in the frontmatter
#   * list (facultative):       set to True if the property is a list of values
#   * item_dir (facultative):   directory containing per-value posts indexes
#   * item_tpl (facultative):   template of the per-value posts indexes
#   * index_name (facultative): filename of the property values index
#   * index_tpl (facultative):  template of the property values index
#
# Filenames are relative to meta_dir and extensions are automatically added.
# When a string value is facultative, it defaults to property name, except for
# index_name, which disables property values global index if not specified.
